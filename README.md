# 2048-Command-Line
The game 2048 played in the command line. Coded in C++.

I began this project a few months ago when I had some downtime during college. The goal was to create the game 2048 played in the command line in C++. I have made some progress but I only spent a few hours on it and the game doesn't function correctly. I plan to finish it later when I have some spare time.
